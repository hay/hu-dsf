# Snacknames
## Basic
Write a program that loops through the names of three friends you predefine in a list. Print out the names and the length of the name.

## Advanced
Extend the program so that after printing the name the program asks for their favourite snack. After completing the loop, loop through the names again and print the name and their favourite snack.
