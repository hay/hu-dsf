### Examples
For every week there is a Jupyter Notebook containing examples relating to the subjects of that week
* [Lessons 1 & 2: Math, variables, `print()`, `input()`, comparisons, types, `if`, string methods](examples/examples-1.ipynb)
* [Lessons 3 & 4: Lists, `for`, `while`, files, `csv`](examples/examples-2.ipynb)
* [Lessons 5 & 6: dicts, `json`, f-strings, HTTP api's](examples/examples-3.ipynb)
* [Lessons 7 & 8: Reddit / `praw`, Pandas](examples/examples-4.ipynb)
* [Lessons 9 & 10: Web scraping](examples/examples-5.ipynb)

#### Tips
* Google and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your friends. It’s not a shame to Google even really basic concepts. I have been programming for more than twenty years and i still Google really basic stuff every single day.
* Your code should be properly commented (use `#`). Good commenting means you explain why you do something, not what you’re doing.
* Keep your code DRY: Do not Repeat Yourself. If you copy-paste code, you probably could use a function instead.
* Keep it tidy! Python is a language where indentation matters. This means that if you don’t format your code properly it won’t work.
* Make sure you all your code is correctly spelled. Python is very picky! If you write `If` instead of `if` (note the capital) your code won’t work.
* If you don’t understand why something isn’t working, try to make an example that is as simple as possible to pinpoint the cause.
* Pay close attention to the error output you get when you run a command. Google it if you don’t understand it.
* Note that Python is case sensitive and most file systems are too. When you create a new file only use lowercase characters, no spaces (use the underscore `_` instead).
* Read all the comments in the examples i provide. 90% of the things asked in the assignments are already solved for you there.
